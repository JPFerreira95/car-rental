# Car Rental
This project is inspired in a OOP course that I had in university.

## Objectives

The objectives that led me to create this project are:
 - Apply Spring Boot in all back-end applications, with the use of Spring Security, Spring Web and Spring Data.
Get;
 - Use of MongoDB as the main database;
 - Use of Redis for cache;
 - Integrate a front-end UI;
 - Continuous improvement.

## Summary

Just like *Uber*, the intent of this project is to create a platform on which a customer can rent a service of 
transportation from a driver with its private car and drive that customer to a certain location.\
We can create two types of users: a customer and a driver.\
The driver can register one or more vehicles, and a customer can rent a driver's service to take him to where he needs 
to be.\
Both of them can rate each other after a trip, and each trip is saved to view their history.
